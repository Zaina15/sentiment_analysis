# ðŸ¤– Sentiment Analysis with Deep Learning using BERT

This project demonstrates how to fine-tune a pretrained BERT model using PyTorch for multi-class sentiment analysis on Twitter data. It covers every step of building an NLP pipeline, including data preprocessing, model customization, training, evaluation, and performance visualization.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset

We use the **SMILE Twitter Emotion Dataset**, which contains annotated tweets labeled with various emotions:  

- **Emotions:** happiness, sadness, anger, disgust, surprise, fear  
- Dataset size: ~6,600 tweets

## ðŸ›  Features

âœ… **Preprocessing & Tokenization**  
- Cleaned text data and converted categorical labels to numerical encodings.  
- Used HuggingFaceâ€™s `BertTokenizer` for tokenizing and encoding tweet data.  

âœ… **Model Building**
- Loaded `bert-base-uncased` pretrained model from HuggingFace Transformers.  
- Adjusted architecture for multi-class classification.  

âœ… **Training & Optimization**
- Customized optimizer (AdamW) and learning rate scheduler for efficient fine-tuning.  
- Built reusable training and evaluation loops to monitor model performance and save checkpoints.  

âœ… **Evaluation**
- Computed weighted **F1-score** and per-class accuracy for model assessment.  
- Saved and reloaded fine-tuned models for later use.
